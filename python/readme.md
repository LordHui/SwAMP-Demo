# Python version of the SwAMP demo

This version of the demo is purely conceptual: since it's in Python, it
allows one to see more clearly how to implement the algorithm. However, it's
very slow; if you have MATLAB installed on your computer, you should try the
C (MEX) version!

To run this demo, just execute the 'demo.py' file. You need to have Python
2.7x and the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries installed on your computer.
