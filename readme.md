# SwAMP Demo User's Manual

Using this demo is supposed to be straightforward: one needs only to
open Matlab, go to the current folder and run the command `demo`.

When the demo starts, a compilation will take place.
SwAMP is written in C and must be compiled using Matlab's MEX API. If you
have a C compiler on your computer, everything should (hopefully) go smoothly!
We have tested the compilation using `gcc` in different platforms, but we'd
expect it to work with other compilers as well. Make sure to run `mex -setup` if you have no previously used Matlab's MEX feature. 

If you have problems, you can try the Python version which, in spite of
being much slower, achieves the same results. 

The SwAMP repository is [hosted on GitHub.](https://github.com/eric-tramel/SwAMP-Demo).

## A few details

- The demo script calls functions from the the `examples`
  folder. By exploring these, one may get a better grasp of how to use
  SwAMP.

- SwAMP's source code is located on the `src` folder; in particular, the
  bulk of the algorithm is contained in the `src/solvers/amp.c` file. 
  This version
  follows exactly the listings in the paper, and is already optimized to
  work with sparse matrices. Additionally, 3 other versions are present in
  the same folder: 
    * `gamp.c`, which implements G-SwAMP; 
    * `amp_dense.c`, a version that isn't optimized for sparse matrices; 
    * and `amp_alt.c`, a slight modification of the algorithm that, in spite of reaching the same results, sometimes converges faster.
